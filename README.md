# 🚆 RailGenius – Railway Reservation System

**RailGenius** is a full-stack railway reservation system inspired by UTS and M-Indicator, built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The system provides a seamless and modern web-based platform for train ticket booking, cancellations, schedule browsing, and real-time availability checks.

This project modernizes railway booking experiences with features like class-wise seat selection, secure payments, voice assistant support, and email confirmations. It serves as both a practical full-stack development showcase and a functional smart travel planning tool.
